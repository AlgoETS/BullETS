# Contributing

Before contributing, please discuss your changes with other by either taking care of an existing unassigned issue, creating a new issue or discussing your changes in the club's Discord server.

Please keep in mind that you must respect the code of conduct at all times when contributing to the project.

## Version control branching
- Always make a new branch for your work. You will then be able to create a pull request that will have to be reviewed by other contributors in order to merge your work.
- Do not submit unrelated changes in your pull request, as it will be rejected.
- New features and bugfixes should branch off of the  `main` branch.

## Code formatting
Follow the [PEP-8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the general style found in existing code.

## Documentation
This project follows [Google's docstrings style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). 

Document as much as you can new features and existing features that you are modifying. A lack of documentation may result in your pull request being rejected.

## Testing
We encourage you to make tests for any new features and update existing tests when modifying features.

A test-driven development approach allows us to quickly make sure that any changes made to the code do not break existing features.
